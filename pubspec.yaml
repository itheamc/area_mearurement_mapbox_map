  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
#  assets:
#    - assets/icons/
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#    - family: Railway
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
#          style: italic
#    - family: ProductSans
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/ProductSans-Regular.ttf
#        - asset: assets/fonts/ProductSans-Bold.ttf
#          weight: 700
#    - family: SoloSellIcons
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/arrow-svg-icons/SoloSellIcons.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
